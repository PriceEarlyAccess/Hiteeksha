2,Am I really the only one who still plays this game?,"Maybe. Haven't tried it myself in quite some time. It just seemed over-complicated and difficult to understand at the time,"
3,Am I really the only one who still plays this game?,"i wanna play it ,but i can find a (trusted) page for download it"
4,Am I really the only one who still plays this game?,"Its actually still pretty interesting. Mind you, I hesitated to say fun"
5,Am I really the only one who still plays this game?,Steam?
6,"So is this game and by extension, subreddit, dead?",Sadly - bought it and never played more than 10 minutes due to having no idea what to do.
7,"So is this game and by extension, subreddit, dead?","Yes, unfortunately. Crippling bugs, no updates. Games like Kinetic Void give EA a really bad wrap."
8,"So is this game and by extension, subreddit, dead?","Woah I'm still subbed to this? Yeah, the game died. EA sucks."
9,"So is this game and by extension, subreddit, dead?",And having looked into it deeper I've learned something new: the game is in limbo/development hell. The lead developer said 2 people left the project after the cash ran out so they're working on a side project to get the ball rolling again. 
10,"So is this game and by extension, subreddit, dead?","This game ended up being made by one guy, and he is out of money. Give it some slack."
11,Kinetic Void 1.0.7 Short Shipyard Tutorial/Fact-Guide,"nice vid.  If you continue, consider doing your next vid on a mission, or combat or trade or something.

I can build a ship well enough but when I launch it, I have NFI what to do.  Between a bad gui and bugged missions, I really don't know what to do.  This game has been on the shelf for months for me as I don't know how to play.

I know it is in development, but I don't know what options exist right now and how to make that happen.  Cheers."
12,Kinetic Void 1.0.7 Short Shipyard Tutorial/Fact-Guide,"Well, I don't know much about the mission framework - I just build ships, then fly them around shooting other ships until I get bored with the current ship; or I explode.

I know the dev team is small, and well... ""slow,"" but you'd get a bit more information about missions checking with them on the steam forum; or asking on one of their youtube videos/channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/BadlandStudioLLC"
13,Patch D15.2 is live on Steam!,[deleted]
14,Patch D15.2 is live on Steam!,"I've been trying! Haha. It will be a bit quite now as we're getting closer to release, but we're sort of at a point where over marketing now wouldn't gather many gains. But in a month or so, we'll do what we can to get the ball rolling more in marketing.

But for now, those who want to help can follow us on twitter https://twitter.com/kineticvoid or @kineticvoid and retweet and favourite. Share your ships on Steam, take screenshots, talk about the game on your blog, twitter, facebook or writing a review on Steam. Every little bit helps and it it always appreciated."
15,"Kinetic Void is currently 66% off on steam! Come join us in space, or grab one for a friend!","Question - with the game in it's current state, is there anything to do in-game?  I mean, if I bought it today, I accept there is a lot I can't do (yet), but what are some things I can do?

Can I make money?  Can I shoot things?  Can I trade?  Can I explore?  Can I build?  Can I multiplay?

Just not sure if I should get onboard yet.  Cheers."
16,"Kinetic Void is currently 66% off on steam! Come join us in space, or grab one for a friend!","Hey /u/Togfox! Good questions!  
There are quite a few things you can do, at the moment.  

**Can I make money?**  Yes you can. Missions offer rewards and payouts, and trading can be done in a flucation economy. You really have to keep on top of what is worth trading though, as it can change quite rapidly if say, there is a war or some other major event going on.  
**Can I shoot things?** Yes you can. There are random missions around the world, that will pop up such as defending a helpless ship or station. Or going to war with an enemy faction, who may have even stolen one of your ship designs for their own nefarious use.   
**Can I trade?**  Yes you can. The economy is always changing and different sectors need different goods. There is lots of money to be made if you pay attention to the world, and the notifications of what is going on around you.
  
**Can I explore?**  Absolutely. The game is as big as you want it to be (you set the amount of sectors and the amount of factions in the world). You can build an exploration vessel and explore as much as you like. And if you see something beautiful, you can hit ( H ) to hide the HUD, and take a screenshot to share.
  
**Can I build?**  Yes! KV is all about building your own, personal ship. It's a big part of the game, but in career mode, you'll really need to hunt down those rare parts you're looking for.
  
**Can I multiplay?**  No, not yet. It is something planned, but unless we get a big boost in support, it wont be more then an area battle mode, post release. We'd love to do open world coop, but the amount of time that would take vs the funds we have just wont work and if we tried now, it wouldn't end up being what people want. So for now, arena mode will come post release and if sales do well, then coop is something we'd really love to do, but do right.

17,"Kinetic Void is currently 66% off on steam! Come join us in space, or grab one for a friend!","This sounds good.  I enjoy large worlds with many factions (my PC is a beast).  I'll see if I can start with a tiny ship, make lots of cash and upgrade it to a leviathon, press H and then immortalise the goodness.  =)

Thx."
18,"Kinetic Void is currently 66% off on steam! Come join us in space, or grab one for a friend!","Fantastic. Be sure to post about your ship and your adventure. I'd love to hear about how it goes! If you have any questions, be sure to ask and I'll do my best to answer."
19,How about some wallpapers? (1080p),Were these taken in game? 
20,How about some wallpapers? (1080p),Yes!
21,Tutorial Preview Video,Looking good. Also: the sub is alive again :) thank you for the amazing game. Keep the great work up. 
22,Tutorial Preview Video,"No problem at all! And thanks for the kind words! I'm hoping we can get this sub even more active. I'd love to see more ships being posted, maybe videos of you guys playing, or even some fan lore."
23,Tutorial Preview Video,I'm actually thinking about doinflg a lp
24,Tutorial Preview Video,That would be fantastic! But sure you share it in here so we can take a look.
25,Tutorial Preview Video,It's probably going to be in German though.
26,Tutorial Preview Video,Nothing wrong with that at all :)
27,"Hi everybody, bls_tehsid here, ready to take command!","Good to see some more community interaction here.

I bought the game 12+ months ago and havent touched it since then.  The UI was too un-intuitive.  Has there been any progress on this front?"
28,"Hi everybody, bls_tehsid here, ready to take command!","It is better, but we still have a ways to go. The idea was to get in something that functioned and then focus on the major game systems that were required. We're getting closer to something that I think is user friendly and tutorials are being worked on as we speak, but we're going to take another pass at user interaction soon.  
  
Its something that we really need people's feedback on and although we get a lot of ""Oh god this is rubbish!"" post with no expanding on that, what we need is people to dive in and tell us what's wrong and how they think it could be better. It helps so much having a fresh set of eyes on something that we've been looking at for, for some of us, 3 years.  
  


"
29,"Hi everybody, bls_tehsid here, ready to take command!","I fully agree with you.  Myself personally,  I dont have enough vested interest in this game to give you the level of info you are after, but I'm sure interacting with the reddit community will be a great start towards getting the detail you need!

I really like the premise of the game, so I look forward to playing a more complete version!"
30,Planned for Development,">Planets should spawn a city on their surface, the player can fly to and dock with.

This feature sounds pretty neat.  Will cities have anything special about them compared to other station types?"
31,Planned for Development,Muptiplayer? Count me even more in.
32,Planned for Development,"We're currently working to see what it is we can do with them to give you a reason to go to there over say, a station above the planet. As it stands though they'll just be another station, but in time we've got idea's on how to make them more useful and interesting."
33,Planned for Development,"It's a little ways off now and it will only be arena fighting until we can work out the logistics of larger scale, open world gameplay. The game as it stands is quite demanding, so there will be a lot of work before we even consider trying to make the single player game a multiplayer experience. But we're very excited by the idea and we hope the arena gameplay gives us some good incite into larger scale stuff and it's requirements."
34,Planned for Development,"Cool, I'm excited to see what will come from this."
35,Planned for Development,"One thing: the more code you write before Mp is implemented, the harder it is to make it Mp ready. (take factorio for example, they are having extreme trouble to make the Mp working)"
36,Planned for Development,Glad to hear it! And so are we.
37,Planned for Development,"That's very true. MP wasn't something that was intended to come to KV at all, but after playing and talking with others, we could see how it could be fun to have. It sure will be lots of work, but here's hoping it pays off."
38,Planned for Development,I wish I could convince friends to buy the game. Cause you devs rock.
39,Planned for Development,Thanks. You have no idea how much that means to us!
40,Humble Bundle Questions,"Urgin:
Right now we focus on shipbuilding and then space combat+asteroid mining.  We're updating once a month (next one will be D13 in June) and plan to add missions, a fluctuating economy system and the ability for players to create and share missions as well as ship modules.  Here's a link to our YouTube channel with some gameplay videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcardEhTDMCMerVWo1_B9Uw"
41,Humble Bundle Questions,"Hej, thanks for the quick reply! I watched the gameplay video of D12 and was just wondering if the game usually runs as jumpy as in the video? Is the game working through optimizations currently or was that just of consequence of her computer? "
42,Humble Bundle Questions,"It's a limitation of me recording with Camtasia, it caps out at 30fps and the game commonly runs higher than that.  I am looking at maybe using FRAPS or ShadowPlay in the future for other videos but am not familiar with them enough to be confident in that direction."
43,Humble Bundle Questions,"Ah ok, great to know! Looked very interesting but the sputtering frame rate looked worrying; glad that that isn't an issue. Thanks for all the replies!"
44,Game is not user-friendly,"Hi Pointless.
There is a tutorial system in the works, and the game guide will be update to reflect the constant changes. But at this point the game is in early access, and having the tutorial in right now is pointless, as so much is changing all the time, it would break with every update.

But if you're keen to try again, check out some of the amazing steam guides that have been written, they'll help you a great deal. Or wait for launch and check out the completed product.

Good luck!"
45,Game is not user-friendly,">This could be an insanely fun game but please please please include some kind of tutorial, and not one that dumps a ton of information on you in very little time.

I'm pretty sure the game isn't finished yet so isn't it a bit early for heavy statements like that? A tutorial would logically be developed last (once the game is feature complete) to prevent the need to keep altering it as new aspects are added/tweaked.

Give it some time to get closer to release before getting too disappointed. You bought into an unfinished product, don't expect it to be finished.

That's not to say you don't have some valid points and feedback. But I think that the tone of your post is off and could be improved to give better criticism."
46,Game is not user-friendly,"Hey guys, I've been working on Steam Guides the last few months, and oodles of gameplay/tutorial videos on our  YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcardEhTDMCMerVWo1_B9Uw , I'm working on a new guide on steam now that's the whole process broken down into manageable chunks (new game, shipyard UI, add your first component etc.)"
47,Game is not user-friendly,I find it plenty user friendly. And it does include an in game manual that explains things. try reading it. might help you.
48,Game is not user-friendly,"I think at this point I'll wait for launch, as I'd like to play the game as it was intended to be played. Thanks for the reply!"
49,How does one hire crew?,"Crew have been removed right now. Early on, the developers just sort of shoehorned it in. They'll be back, but right now you're not missing anything by not having them!"
50,Couple Questions,I get this planetary warning along with broken textures being smeared all across the screen whenever i load a galaxy as well
51,Couple Questions,Try spinning the camera and zooming out. Large ships cover the camera when you load a galaxy most of the time.

53,"Kinetic Void gameplay patch 0.06 with explosions, combat, microwarp and flight yippee!","We are in alpha right now, but have the game available through Early Access on Steam.  We do not have a scheduled release date, but are planning on 2014 sometime."

55,New SubReddit- Kinetic Void Ships,"Why? This subreddit gets like 1 post a month, I doubt ship pics are going to clutter it up and upset people."
56,New SubReddit- Kinetic Void Ships,I thought the same thing. I'm sure that would be a totally valid subreddit if and when this game takes off but right now this subreddit needs all the content it can get.
57,My First Dreadnought Class Ship. Came out like a carrier. what ya think?,I like it! It would become even cooler if the devs put hangar modules in the game and maybe some AI fighters stowed in those hangars that you could launch.

91,Left my computer running all night to see how fast I could make a ship go. Very Fast.,[I think I won. Because fuck relativity](http://i.imgur.com/I8y8k4E.jpg)

94,Left my computer running all night to see how fast I could make a ship go. Very Fast.,"If you will permit me to geek out...

Hmm.. Not exactly. The Mach number is a ratio between the speed of an object moving through a medium, and the local speed of sound in that medium. Since we are moving through space the speed of sound doesn't really make sense, so Mach numbers don't really apply.

Though I guess you mean, if this was traveling in earth's atmosphere (at sea level?) then it's Mach number would be this. Which I guess is ok... Kinda..."
95,Left my computer running all night to see how fast I could make a ship go. Very Fast.,"yeah i considered that, but since theres no way to measure outer space in machs and i dont have any other measurement thats made for really high numbers like that i used sea level machs lol"
96,Left my computer running all night to see how fast I could make a ship go. Very Fast.,"I spotted a chance to use a niche bit of chemistry knowledge and I had to pounce! 21 days late, but I couldn't resist. Figured you would have thought of it if you had used that unit."
97,I broke relativity. Do I win the game?,"  Slight bug to report: I was flying a ship made of the smallest cockpit and the largest engine at a planet at 500km/s or so. I got the planetary proximity warning, my ship was 'destroyed', but only the engine flew off. I immediately jumped to about 2000 km/s and kept going.

  I assume the game kept calculating the thrust using the mass of what was left of my ship. I decided to let it run until I broke relativity. At around 100,000 km/s the audio got very buggy, there was a constant buzzing if I rotated the camera to the front of the 'ship'. The space background also began wobbling back and forth.

But at least I went really really fast. Game didn't crash either, I decided to quit once I exceeded c."
98,I broke relativity. Do I win the game?,We're gonna put a limit on ship speed at some point.
99,Firing Optimisation Idea,">An alternate method could be to heavily reduce the rate of fire of cannons, but bump up the shell velocity and damage to make them feel more like cannons and may'be make their shell decal larger.

We will be doing this, as well as trying some ways to make the projectiles themselves more efficient."
100,Firing Optimisation Idea,"I figured that it would probably be in the works, I just felt like I should mention it just in case!

Sorry if posts like this bug you, I'm assume you guys probably get bugged with ""suggestions"" all the time."
101,Kinetic Void Update; 0.011,"Sorry, I forgot to put em up here. Here are the notes:

0.011 

* Implemented collider optimizations which should improve performance when many large ships are in scene.

* Implemented player collider optimization which may improve performance during warp.

* MAC - slight change to file structure so that factions will load, negating issue with generating solar systems

If I'm late on putting them up here, you can also check the Steam community: http://steamcommunity.com/games/227160/announcements/detail/1837743734762457471"
102,Kinetic Void Update; 0.011,"Ah, thank you!

And very good work on the game, I am loving it!

The collider optimizations are just in time, as I posted earlier, I had some issues with my big ships: http://www.reddit.com/r/KineticVoid/comments/1d67yq/dont_suppose_we_can_get_the_option_to_stop_a_ship/"
103,Kinetic Void Update; 0.011,"Well, let me know if they help. We are also planning to implement an option to not spawn ships above a certain size (and let the players set that size in a menu). This will be especially needed for when players start sharing ship packs. If they include large ships that may strain some PC's, we want a convenient way to simply ignore them."
104,Kinetic Void Update; 0.011,"Yay! 

I removed my massive ship from the Directory just so it would not spawn and lag.

I will let you know shortly if it has helped.

UPDATE 1: The ship I posted a picture of, is now playable at 25fps, up from 11fps. I'm going to go look for another instance of the ship.

UPDATE 2: 6FPS when two of the ship are on screen. A boost from 2FPS. It is now 2FPS whilst the ship is firing, a boost from 0.6FPS."

114,General feedback thread,"I'll start with a few of my own. 

1) on a lot of the parts, the snap points are not centered, or not level. This leads to ships sometimes having parts not aligned correctly. Has this been fixed in the UI overhaul? 

2) when I am making a ship, is there any way to start over with a blank shipyard without deleting the ship I was working on before? 

3) For the most part, the game runs fine, but when I enter micro-warp, my FPS drops to almost nothing, even on the lowest settings. Any idea why, or how to fix it?"
115,General feedback thread,"I'm not sure if this is simply a computer error (iMac running bootcamp windows 7), but the only menu with any options/text is the 'display' tab. Controls, something I'm still trying to figure out, has nothing listed."
116,General feedback thread,"1) Are there any particular parts that are giving you trouble? We are in the process of reviewing the connection nodes on parts.

2) Our next major update (Should be done next week) will be an overhaul for the shipyard. We will include a way to do this.

3) In a recent update we tweaked the particle effect and warp speed to try and alleviate this problem. If we continue to see this issue we will work on another implementation of micro-warp."

* Holding shift in the shipyard will allow repeat placement of a part. The part counter will not update properly, this is a known issue and will be addressed in a future UI overhaul.

* The AI ships were feeling a bit sluggish before, they will now go about their business.

* Asteroids can now be destroyed.

* Fixed planetary proximity warning distance.

* Some ship spawns will now be hostile. Reminder: Hit tab to quickly target hostile contacts, or use micro-warp (shift-T) to flee.

* Ships now have engine effects, these are still a work in progress

* Micro warp drive improvements: Upon toggling the warp drive (default shift-T), the warp drive will charge for a few seconds before initiating. It will then remain on until you toggle it again. After shutting down, the warp drive must charge for 20 seconds before it is used again. The new warp drive has accompanying sound effects for charge up, travel, and exiting warp.

* Adjusted transparency for space fog and space dust so it's easier to notice movement.

* Adjusted planet spawn axis for more variety - Will only affect newly generated galaxies"
119,Patch note thread week of 3-25,"Hnhgh. Tempted to buy. How do you compare yourself to ""Limit Theory""?"
120,Patch note thread week of 3-25,"0.007

* Upon ship death (hull at 0% or destruction of all cockpits), the player will be returned to the shipyard. NPC ships should also be destroyed if one of these conditions is met.

* Adjusted planetary rendering FOV so that the player no longer notices any stretching when at the edge of the screen.

* Adjusted the warp particle effect so that it doesn’t turn with the ship as you exit warp.

* Adjusted MWD travel speed for better framerate.

* UI change: For compatibility reasons, we have begun a UI overhaul. The splash screen has been changed to a new framework.

121,Patch note thread week of 3-25,"Hmm, I don't really feel comfortable comparing us to a game whose only available material is the marketing put out by its creator.
