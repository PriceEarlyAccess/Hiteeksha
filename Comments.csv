0,/r/arma3 has merged with /r/arma,[removed]
1,/r/arma3 has merged with /r/arma,Oh my! You're welcome!
2,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Fragmentation is bad for the community. Merge 'em!
3,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Makes sense. Especially as neither subreddit has a ton of people
4,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Agreed to the merge.
5,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,i think that most that are on arma3 already allso are on arma 
6,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Please merge.
7,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"It honestly a lot of sense.  Hell,  I'm subscribed to both anyways and it's pretty much the same content "
8,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"I'd say merge. Splitting the community makes no sense, /r/arma was established long before /r/arma3 came around.

So yeah, agree to merge. "
9,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I don't see why we should have two semi-active subs instead of one really active one
10,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,yes please! :)
11,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"I agree on the merge, and freezing submissions seems to be the best way (so people can still look at old content, but new submissions get redirected to /r/arma). However, I think that a flair system will be needed for /r/arma, so that Life content can find a home there."
12,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"Honestly, I didn't even know this place existed until like three months ago. Never understood why we needed two subreddits."
13,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"Yes. Neither sub-reddit is active enough to warrant the separation. 


Best way I can figure to merge is to make /r/arma3 redirect to /r/arma."
14,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Is be fine with merging the 2 sub's under the condition that we continue on with the mods or r/arma. Sorry but I've seen the circlejerk of the arma3 mods (not all included) and I have no interest in that mentality here. The majority of the mods (again not all) and the general attitude of r/arma3 are the reason I'm not subbed there.
15,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I am subbed to the Arma sub and TIL there is an arma 3 one too. Merge 'em.
16,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Merge
17,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"WE MUST UNITE AS ONE, UNDER ONE BANNER, UNDER ONE SUB"
18,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I vote merge!
19,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"I support this, I did not even know about this subreddit until this topic appeared on /r/arma."

25,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Please merge them.
26,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Another vote for merge. Cant think of a big reason not to.
27,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,yes please

31,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,merge pls
32,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Please do I'm subbed to both but it would be nice to not switch between them. It sucks trying remember where you saw certain content when you wanna look it up again.
33,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"I say merge it, /r/arma is mostly arma 3 anyways. "
34,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Absolutely yes.
35,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I vote for the merger.
36,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,sure!
37,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I think its a good idea.

41,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Merge. Word to your mother. 
42,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Definitely merge.
43,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,[deleted]
44,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Yeah I think both be merged to one as the community is quite small.
45,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Merge.
46,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,Merge. 
47,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,merge!
48,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"yes!

this is r/arma. it is about all the armas, not just one. so why have several? shut duwn r/arma3 and push them over here"
49,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"Definitely merge.  It's one fewer subreddit I have to subscribe to, heh."
50,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,I agree with the merge but judging upvotes/downvotes for a poll is not the way to go as reddit obfuscates them in a way to confuse bots.
51,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"Did you read my infamous post about Altis Life? ;)

Merge 'em."

62,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,"/r/arma is for COMMUNISTS.

71,Anyone know when the game will next go on sale?,"G2a.com its pretty much always on the sale.
https://www.g2a.com/arma-iii-steam-cd-key-global.html
I bought it when it was 25 euro and got my steam key within 5 minutes. No need to register and i used paypal. Btw it might be out of stock so wait for a bit and check there when it comes up. I waited like 1hr till i could buy.
EDIT: Btw on g2a now it costs 29 euro."
72,Anyone know when the game will next go on sale?,"Wouldn't be suprised if Arma III would appear in steam summer sale. Thought, I could expect sale coming July"
73,does arma 3 suppport steering wheels?,"yes it supports it as any other joystick and better now that some updates ago the analog vehicle movement was improved.


Anyways its not really that usefull unless you are going to be all the mission as driver since when you jump out the vehicle or in you may need to take the wheel and drop the mouse and its a bit troublesome, specially if you are under fire, i can assure you it can get really messy :P.


The real advantage on having a steering wheel its more on the pedals, since the analog steering with the mouse its already good if you want that kind of control. The pedals give you better control over you velocity and allow you to keep slow speeds easilly. You can also use the pedals for flying, so thats another use.

So if you already have a steering wheel and you want to test it with arma, do it. But i wont recomend you to buy it just for arma since keyboard or even mouse control(personally dont like it) its more than enough for ground vehicles."
74,does arma 3 suppport steering wheels?,Awesome.thanks for the reply
75,New patch troubleshooting,[removed]
76,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"I don't have access to the game atm but I'll try to recall from memory.

In the editor:

* Place down the ""Manage Addons"" (I think it's called that) module
* Add the names of the addons you want to include
* Sync the module to the ""Zeus Game Master"" module
* Play!

An example of the name of an addon would be ""kae_sz_infantry"" (Without quotation marks). You can find out the names of the addons by looking at the ""Addons"" folder in the directory of the mod. The addons folder should look something like [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj7l9ankrg3gzjl/Screenshot%202014-05-04%2014.53.46.png)."
77,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"It depends on the what mods or scripts you would like to use. If you are using something like VAS, TAW VD, or some sort of revive script they need to be included in the mission file its self. This is usuallly done by creating a new mission and adding in the zeus module from the editor.

As for weapon and vehicle mods they should be included in the zeus mission as long as they are loaded into Arma. Most likely listed under Men -> Empty -> Other."
78,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"Gonna add a question to this, how would I host a Zeus game, I really want to play Zeus with my friend, just him and me though."
79,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"Certain mods support Zeus and are integrated into it, some are not. For instance you can drop the F-18 while in the ZEUS menu, but cannot drop other modified vehicles. It is up to the modders to include them in the ARMA structure properly, I don't understand how they do this I just know some modders add this and some don't"
80,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"I'm no expert but, i think i've read somewhere that you can't. Can't find where tho. "
81,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"I did a small mission ""Zeus Sandbox"". It's just Zeus and a Blufor Player (I did it aswell, wanted to play with my friend). If you want it, tell me and I'll upload it on dropbox or something like this."
82,How do I add mods to Zeus?,[This is the mod](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=25551) I want to add. On some of the screenshots you can see that they are added into the Zeus.
83,How do I add mods to Zeus?,You can. Check my post to see how.
84,How do I add mods to Zeus?,Well I saw on screenshots that they added some wander panzer from the 'wap' mod into Zeus.
85,How do I add mods to Zeus?,Can you upload it to Steam Workshop?
86,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"I have never had to manually add a mod, they are automatically loaded when you launch Zeus. This is confusing, I would ask in the BIS thread the developer has"
87,How do I add mods to Zeus?,Thank you.
88,How do I add mods to Zeus?,"Hm...i think, there's two zeus-es...one official, and..some fan made ? Because there were scheenshots and videos on youtube of zeus stuff, before it was released, officially, right ? "

91,"Battle Royale, which is the best gun in the mod?",depends on personal pref. i like the standard katiba since its way easier to find fitting silencers
92,"Battle Royale, which is the best gun in the mod?","The thing is to have the right scope and zeroing, having a rangefinder helps alot with this. Staying prone helps accuracy more than you can believe, if you stand upright and not aiming down the scopes you can easily take down a guy right next to you, but if you try to do the same with a guy 100 m away you'll be lucky if any of the bullets hit. I have a personal preferance with the M24 Sniper rifle. Other than that the SIG SG 550(not sure if this is the exact specific model for it) is pretty neat with the different ammo types such as armor penetration ammo and the GL attachment.
If you really want to rip up someones shit go for a machinegun, they are very good for shooting up people in cars and trucks and disabling said vehicles.

Remember, when you see the blue zone, get there as fast as possible or suffer the concequenses. Red zone isnt necessarily a death sentance, I myself have been in it several times without dying, Just stay out of the big buildings in it.

93,"Battle Royale, which is the best gun in the mod?","Just drove into a netting fence with a quad, and it blew up. #wat"
94,"Battle Royale, which is the best gun in the mod?","I've only found 3 katibas in the 15~games i've played

97,A buggy mess,"Really? I went through the campaign with no problems whatsoever. Although the copy of the game I have is illegal. You could re-download the game or check cache integrity through Steam. If you installed mods, then that could be the source of the problem.


For judgmental ""anti-piracy"" people, I'm under-aged and I have no income, just for you to know."
98,A buggy mess,It's purely vanilla and I've re-installed twice already.

101,"Just purchased Arma 3, need some help","You need to enable battle royal with your launcher, I used to have this problem.  The way I installed it and play it is through playwithsix, so that automatically turns it on if I run it through the program."
102,"Just purchased Arma 3, need some help",Playwithsix is a great program for mods. Allows you to download and play pretty much any mods that out there. Also if you need any help with downloading playwithsix there are plenty of videos on YouTube for that.

106,"I found this ""TrackIR like"" SW that uses a webcam. Settings are bit clumsy but it works. Does anybody use this?","It works sorta okay when flying, but requires a good webcam and lighting. It isn't responsive enough to be enjoyable when on foot for me though. Settings are entirely customizable, so I may just have bad settings."
107,"I found this ""TrackIR like"" SW that uses a webcam. Settings are bit clumsy but it works. Does anybody use this?","I tried this out about a year ago with Arma 2, didn't have a whole lot of luck. Spent about 4 days configing and tweaking and never getting anywhere. From what I read online it requires very specific settings (physically) to work properly. "
108,"I found this ""TrackIR like"" SW that uses a webcam. Settings are bit clumsy but it works. Does anybody use this?","I have used this and it's amazing for a free program. It can sometimes fail to recognize my face at important moments in combat though. It also has trouble with subtle movements.  

I have used this with DCS:World and a heavily modified Rfactor. Never thought to try Arma."
109,"I found this ""TrackIR like"" SW that uses a webcam. Settings are bit clumsy but it works. Does anybody use this?","Tried setting it up with Arma 3, I managed to get it working almost perfectly with a 35fps Skype certified camera (very old), but only under perfect sunlight. Even slight change and it starts wobbling around like and old drunk soldier.

I believe this works much better if you have TrackClip or make one of your own, since you can then choose that instead of face tracking and it also consumes less CPU power (face tracking is expensive)."

119,Dedicated Server Hardware review.,"My God where are you that you're paying $60 for a 10 slot server? I'm currently paying $16.60 for a 20 slot server through Vilayer, though I did get that on sale. 

As far as the specs go, I haven't run a dedicated server wtih Arma 3 yet, but I use to run 3 DayZ servers on a 2.7GHz Xeon Quad Core w/ 4GB Ram and a 500GB Hard Drive. On top of the DayZ servers we ran our website (With custom Admin tools) and mumble from this dedicated server."
120,Dedicated Server Hardware review.,"I don't want to go shaming my host publicly.
Aside from their lucrative pricing scheme, they have been ""very"" accommodating and ultra responsive. 
It's simply just too expensive over the long term.
And even at 20$ a month, with a title like Arma and its likely 10 year life cycle, it's not hard to justify an investment in hardware.

My problem lies in that when I go to a website that does CPU performance benchmark comparisons, the numbers don't look promising on the Xeon front. 
They seem to perform an astoundingly low number of calculations in relation to their modern counterparts. Even a dual quad server would be significantly slower performance wise than a single modern dual core.
Perhaps I don't really understand what I'm reading in terms of how it relates to everyday performance. They are after all just arbitrary numbers!
So I still really don't know if a modern desktop style PC would indeed be the wisest decision performance and consolidation wise.
Its just that those old Xeon servers are just so damn cheap now!
Much cheaper than what parting a completely new box out is going to cost.

I have put over 500 hours into A3 and still use mostly vanilla. Most settings are trial and error for your system. Everyone is different and A3 can be finicky at best.

Get it running well enough and then put a few hours in. After that you can get your settings top notch.

140,"New to Arma 3. What are some ESSENTIAL settings to change to improve performance, mods to download et cetera.","Also, the best thing you can do for Arma performance is to invest in an SSD.  The RV engine relies heavily on HDD texture streaming to render it's insanely massive worlds.  So the faster your disk drive is, the faster it will load those textures in, preventing the most extreme cases of LOD pop, drastically lowering your load times, and most importantly, raising your average MinimumFPS, providing an overall smoother experience.

I will suggest this though, when you install it.  Don't ghost your data from the HDD to the SSD.  I tried this, assuming it would be fine due to the SSDs inability to be affected by fragmentation.  And at the time, I did think it was fine, as it was already a huge upgrade over my HDD.  But I realized much later that doing it like that took away roughly 40% of the drive's performance.  

Always do a fresh install. "
150,"New to Arma 3. What are some ESSENTIAL settings to change to improve performance, mods to download et cetera.","It depends on if the 'server' is checking keys or not.  If you're running the mission from your PC or another's, there likely wouldn't be any indication outside of possible script errors popping up once or twice and a lot of .rpt spam.  For instance, if you start a coop mission from your PC and others join it while you're running say.. refined vehicles, and they're not, there wouldn't be a huge problem.  Your vehicle physics would use the mod values, while the other players would use vanilla.   But if you were to use one of the custom cars that Red Phoenix includes, it would probably be invisible to other players.  

On the other hand, if you were to try joining a dedicated server that didn't have these mods keyed up, it'd simply kick you.  It might tell you what the offending addon is, it might not.

155,ARMA 3 Reddiquette,yes you can post info about your group here I used to run 48MI till i left and just started a steam gaming community EIGS 
156,ARMA 3 Reddiquette,Cool thanks for the tips. I'll keep this post up because I think it's good if people have other questions or contributions to ARMA 3 etiquette.
157,ARMA 3 Reddiquette,this. this is also a good way to show a little bit your play style so people have a better understanding of the type of players you're looking for. 
158,ARMA 3 Reddiquette,"Typically in these situations, it's just one guy or another who came from an old clan with a few of his old clanmates.  They get neck deep in another clan, annoyed with the fact that they're outranked, and then break off, convincing as many as he can to follow suit.  

When you dig into the history of some of the oldest gaming groups, you'll see this has happened quite a bit more than expected.  "

160,Arma 3 and laptops,"Prior to my friend having his PC sent from KC, he used an ASUS RoG laptop that ran arma 3 great. You should be fine.

You will need more harddrive space. If you don't have the cash to upgrade your ssd, a 3.0 USB external hdd will work fine, you just need to set up your download locations on steam.

ALSO, to anybody using a laptop for gaming. Buy a laptop fan. It sits under your laptop and blows cool air from the bottom. Your laptop WILL get hot and sluggish without it. They are fairly cheap so I would get it asap."
161,Arma 3 and laptops,Well I have a 1tb internal hd that isn't ssd. I figured I would install arma on the 150g ssd and anything else on the internal 1tb. Thoughts?
162,Arma 3 and laptops,"Sounds good.. It really just helps with load time man.. If you got the space, great.. But really ssd just makes whatever's on it get loaded a lot faster.. But not necessary at all.. I've got the bigger and more graphically intense textured games on ssd .. And there's a definite advantage over regular HDD but if you don't mind a loading screen for an extra 10-20 seconds.. Who gives a shit"
163,Arma 3 and laptops,"If you can get arma 3 on your ssd, great. ArmA continuously streams information from your hd during gameplay but other than initial load times it won't be all that noticeable so I wouldn't sweat it if you need to move it to your 1TB drive.

Did you get that laptop fan yet?"
164,Arma 3 and laptops,"no i havent... all the ones on the market say for laptops up to 17"" and mine is 17.3"" i dont think the dimensions will work.. i might have to get a 18 or 19"" fan.. any recommendations ? 
"
165,Arma 3 and laptops,"17"" will be fine. Its not going to clip on or anything, the laptop just sits on top of the fan. Duel fans are ideal."

I hope this includes bipods and weapon resting though!"
170,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,Finally the helicopters are being updated. Many many people are gonna love this.
171,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,This deserves the front page of the internet.
172,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,Is anyone else just holding out for ARMA3:Project Reality ?
173,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"Sounds great, but still nothing about driving mechanics? Maybe it's just me, but I feel like driving vehicles is worse than in Arma 2. It just doesn't feel very good, at all.

I mean I love the game and of course I'll continue playing it, but I really heavily dislike vehicles in Arma 3."
174,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,I am certainly one of them.  can't wait to see what they do. 
175,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,I'll take the no replies and the one downvote as a no then ;).
176,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"I think it's significantly better, I used to play a lot of DayZ mod and the driving was awful

In Arma 3 it's quite fun and very easy to control the vehicles "
177,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,Agreed.
178,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"I'm in the other camp, I think the vehicle mechanics are a lot better in Arma 3. It definitely does need work, though, because even on my machine - which is no slouch - I experience obvious stutters while driving. Doesn't matter what the situation is. Input response is slow, too.

Having said that, however, the addition of working suspension to vehicles, better collision, and stats integrity (like the fuel tank not being the size of a timble) are all improved, in my opinion."
179,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"In Arma 2, you could steer with a mouse, which was weird at first, but after a couple of sessions, I got used to it and found it to be very smooth and accurate.

This option doesn't exist in Arma 3 anymore, unless I'm too stupid to find it. Well, you can use a mouse, but then the steering is just completely broken.

On top of that, the vehicles still feel like feathers. Driving just feels cheap, and it's far from being realistic. 

It's just not on par with flying or infantry movement, and Bohemia doesn't even talk about it.

"
180,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"I think in Arma 2, unless you were using a real steering wheel, the mouse was the best option for this. I remember disliking it at first as well, because I was using A and D or the arrow keys for it, but with the mouse, it was very smooth and accurate. There were still various other issues, of course, but it felt relatively good.

In Arma 3, I have to quickly tap A or D for subtle steering. That's just not what I want to do in a simulation game. And you could say that, well, get a steering wheel. But no. It worked in Arma 2, and I think that the mouse actually a very legitimate option, that should be available in Arma 3 as well. So that's my first criticism. (I say this every time; if this option actually exists and I'm just too stupid to find it, pls tell me. I know that you can bind steering to the mouse, but it doesn't work like in Arma 2. At least not for me)

The second one is that vehicles just have zero mass and feel anything but realistc. They feel like feathers and this in conjunction with the point above completely kills the fun for me.

And that bothers me. Because I love the game and I usually enjoy driving in games. But Armas driving mechanics just feel cheap. And Bohemia doesn't even talk about it.

I guess saying that it's worse is a bit of an exaggeration, but it just does not feel like it's supposed to in a simulation. And last I checked, vehicles were a big part of the military."
181,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"I never used the mouse, it just didn't work for steering in any version of arma for me

I find I'm much more accurate with the keyboard

Flying is another matter, that I do use the mouse for"
182,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,Try plugging in a game controller.  Then you can steer with an analog stick.
183,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"But steering with a mouse works pretty much the same like with a real steering wheel. You move it a certain distance, and then once you release it, it centers on its own. A keyboard will never be as accurate as this. I understand that with a mouse it might feel awkward but it makes for a more realistic driving, and maybe I sound like a weidro, but that's what a simulation is supposed to be.

I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm a whiny, hating kid. I'm not. I'm just getting a bit frustrated, because the driving mechanics or rather vehicles in general, aren't as good as other parts of the game, even though they should be. Vehicles are a big part of the military, but to me it seems like Bohemia kind of ignore them :("
184,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,[deleted]
185,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,It's realistic enough for the military who purchased the larger version of it for Battlespace or whatever they call it.  How is it not a simulation?  It's hands down more realistic than any simulation that was out 10 years ago.
186,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"VBS3 is the military version, Virtual Battle Simulator, imagine Arma with more care for accuracy and less for Playability. (as far as im aware, i havent used it, only seen ""game""play footage)"
187,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,Vbs is nothing like arma. Arma is getting designed as a game more and more. Vbs is a pure simulation program 
188,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"Why don't you run down some of the differences?

>Arma is getting designed as a game more and more.

Arma is the same engine marketed as an entertainment product."
189,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"It came from the same engine. It is no longer the same engine. That doesn't mean it behaves in the exact same way. They are completely separate companies with their own teams, goals and costumers. It has nothing to do with 'larger version'. VBS used completely different assets. VBS has better vehicle simulation. VBS has better damage simulation (and wounding systems). VBS is designed to set up realistic scenarios with a 3D editor and has payed extensions and editors for it. VBS does slightly different rendering. VBS exists purely out of 'real' stuff. VBS3 will use dynamic biomes. VBS can handle structures going underground (Make a house with a cellar, plop up down somewhere and it lets you walk under the terrain properly). 

Need I go on? Its like saying Need for Speed and Battlefield are the same game. They have the same publisher (ArmA and VBS do not). They both use the Frostbite engine (Exact different I don't know). Making a gaming authentic doesn't make it a simulation. "
190,Arma 3 Roadmap 2014/15,"These all sound like things that could be rolled into the A3 engine, except perhaps the underground..."

221,Preformance tips for laptop user,"I know you've probably been told this before, but ArmA games do not run particularly well on laptops. Yeah, you could maybe get away with it on ArmA II, but ArmA III is not gonna take your laptop kindly. It's simply that laptops cannot host the resources needed to handle a game like ArmA III very well - it's well known that ArmA III is very CPU intensive, runs on an outdated engine, and is not completely optimized yet. If you want to get anything more than 25 FPS max, you're going to have to use a desktop.

I know, it's not fair that ArmA 3 does this, but we can't do anything to fix it unfortunately. "

247,"Please direct all 'Life' posts to the new Subreddit, created just for Lifers!","yes it would, and thats why this guy should go away with his division of the community crap.

Hes trying to divide an already small enough community.   Hell most of the time i think an A3 subreddit is completely unnecesarry, as we already have /r/arma, but *this guy* here thinks its important to segregate the community based upon gameplay styles and game modes, since the majority of people at /r/arma have no interest in seeing altis life crap.    Though its not that some dont want to see that stuff, its that the majority dont, and he cant take getting downvoted to get his content out there for people to see.

Please stop trying to divide things toxic.    If the only thing you are worried about when posting to the arma subs is how many upvotes and downvotes you get, you probably shouldnt contribute to begin with, and if that isnt what you are trying to mitigate then why?    

There are never enough new posts to /r/arma to justify the claim that no one will see your content because of downvoting.    Anyone that hits the new tab or spends more than a few minutes on it will see the whole days content and have the opportunity to par rouse it.

this is bad for the community as a whole to try and divide it.   "

it is happening to everyone.   if people would just ignore the damn downvotes and stop worrying about their kharma score, we would see a plethora of content here we dont normally.

i sincerely fucking hate reddits voting system.      

if you didnt notice once people piped up about videos being boring and all that gets posted here, it started changing, it went a little extreme.   Now hardly anyone can post a mission vid without it getting downvoted to oblivion.

267,[A3] Cerberus Addon for Arma 3,"The project was started about 2 weeks ago and its making very steady progress. A lot of features like the extended 3D editor are in but need heavy testing. The medical system has all the UI and icons implemented, we now just need to decided on the damage states ect. I'm also sure bull has done a lot of work on the campaign.

As for the team Bull is currently doing all the work but I will be stepping in soon to do a lot of the medical system code and other realism features once the UI is ready.

To sum up what Bull as said:

This mod will be a huge addon to arma 3 that will give more freedom and features into the creation of missions. Most importantly it will add more features to make the game more realistic, fun and immersive (for example the medical system).

280,Anyone with similar specs?,"I had a 5850 for maybe a year and it did a good job on Arma (replaced with GTX770 a month ago). My bottleneck was my old Q8400 CPU, replaced it with a i5-3570k and it runs perfecly (had to buy new mobo etc). 

Like truent0r said, your CPU will be the bottleneck here, for some reason AMD CPU's have a hard time with Arma (some of them), [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/arma3/comments/223yk2/upgrading_my_pc_will_this_be_able_to_run_arma3/cgjtzxf) is a reply from a user here i had about this problem.

Other than that you should be fine to play the game, be warned though that in MP some servers have script heavy maps or have low specs, even if you have a killer rig you will be bound to server FPS, there is no way around it even if you adjust your graphics etc. If a server gives you poor FPS then look for another one. Your benchmark should be SP, if you get good FPS in SP then you know that its the MP server that cuts your FPS. Hope this helps."
281,Anyone with similar specs?,"Not gonna be good man.. Maybe single player will be doable but multiplayer not so much. Your CPU benchmark shows 2054, I had 3500 and multiplayer ran like crap until I got a new i5 Intel processor.. If you plan on upgrading soon, id grab it when it goes on sale 30-35$ range.. Then see how it runs, but I wouldn't pay full price for a game thatll most likely be to clunky to play..

Sorry for the bad news.. But I don't want you to spend $60 and have it not be playable.. Good luck brothah"

Alternatively, if you bought it off g2a or something the keys there are region specific. I almost bought a Russian key, but decided the site looked a little shady and I just bought it straight off Steam.

1: Create a new document in Notepad and click File > Save As and make the File name this:

steam_appid.txt

It's important the .txt is at the end (indicates the file type, but make sure you don't accidentally make it steam_appid.txt.txt).

Inside of the steam_appid.txt should be JUST the following numbers:

107410

For example, if in step 2 your URL was steam://rungameid/107410 , the contents of your steam_appid.txt should be 107410)

Place the new steam_appid.txt file you just created into the Arma 3 folder. By default, it is located at ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3

If a file already exists simply overwrite it.

In Steam, click 'Games > Add a Non-Steam game to my Library'. Add the Arma3.exe. By default, it is at ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3

You can also start the game by simply clicking Arma3.exe from windows explorer. The game will run without a VPN. 

Hope this helps."
311,"I bought Arma 3, did i just get scammed?","Haha, if I was a betting man I would say that you just bought the wrong region key. I know people that buy from g2a, I just couldn't do it so I went with steam and spent an extra $20 haha.  
  
Try and contact their customer service and see if you can exchange yours for the correct one, not sure how that works for digital product keys though. I suppose there's gotta be a way."
312,"I bought Arma 3, did i just get scammed?","Great tip! Thanks alot, I'm installing the game right now so will definitely try it out later.

317,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"I really don't think it would make any noticeable difference, as armas physx runs on the CPU only."
318,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"I have nearly the same setup as you, but a FX 6100 @ 3.9GHz and a GTX 660, so a bit weaker. For me the game runs somehow fine as long as I'm not in multiplayer.

1. I don't know how much you are in the game's engine so forgive me if I assume you don't know: In Arma 3 multiplayer there is nothing you can do about the performance since it is limited to the server performance. Yes, it is really dumb and a relict from the old times of Arma 1 and OFP, and should be at least changed for the next iteration of the game if not patched some day.

2. Also I've noticed that the FX 6100 is really weak even overclocked, which is a real problem since Arma games are heavily dependend on CPU competence. Maybe it is kind of the same with the FX 6300 and therefore your bottleneck as soon as the action starts to show up.

I can't tell too much about my performance in action scenarios because I've primarily been using the game as vacation simulator for the last months^^"
319,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"I don't understand the engine of this game. I am running a 780ti and if I play battle royale I will average about 100 FPS, switch it to something like king of the hill and it dips to like 50. Definitely still very playable though."
320,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"Well on my 4670k system with a 7850 I run at between 30 and 70 fps (usually around 40)

While my friends pc with a 2500k and a gtx 760 he gets a solid 60 fps running almost maxed out "
321,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"balls, i thought it was running APEX for some reason. "
322,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"TY for the reply. In SP I average over 60fps, but in MP it struggles to maintain 27. I typically see ~30% load on both cpu and gpu which is baffling. I'm hoping that they patch it so I can spread the load across all 6 cores and/or find legitimate hardware for dedicated servers. "
323,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"oh I'm sorry, i drifted away from the real question. No I don't think you will experience a much better performance as brendanvista already said."
324,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,Frames per second (you) and simulations are second (server) are a different thing.
325,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,What you're describing is the fps lag caused by the server and the only thing you can do about that is buy a real nice server and don't run too many servers on it
326,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,They are both multiplayer modes though. Must be the amount of people vs city or country and what not. It is just a bigger range than I see in other games.
327,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"Ah. So servers are max capped at 50 SPS (simulation cycles per second). This include all scripts, players info, AI, ballistics, etc. So the more of these you have the slower the server will get.


While the scripting language is easy to learn its is also easy to over complicate cause more SPS issues."
328,Performance delta with dedicated PhysX card?,"So basically you are saying that your FPS is at least somewhat dependent on the server you are in? I have seen some latency issues that make a game look like a slideshow(I am looking at you World of Warcraft) but that doesn't seem to be an issue in this game.  
  
Oh well, I suppose I should feel lucky never even seeing a FPS hiccup, but I wish it was optimized to run better for more people."

332,Looking to buy a laptop for ARMA III.,I haven't tried as I don't have a recent laptop but its a bit of a crap shoot with arma 3. Some peoples machines run it great others horrible. I have an i5 4430 and a gtx 760 2gb with a ssd and I barely get 60 frames in single player on very high graphics with vsync caustics and ambient occlusion off and in multiplayer the framerate is determined by the server and usually runs around 30-40 fps but sometimes dips to 5-10.. I'm not sure how it runs on laptops but I wouldn't want to be the first to try
333,Looking to buy a laptop for ARMA III.,"I can't really talk about how it will run on specifics, I play on a monster gaming PC, but I would definitely suggest something with an i7, a dedicated video card, AND as much RAM as you can get.  
  
It still may run like shit, the game is funny with performance across different hardware, but the stuff above is a good start. Personally I would say if you want to play a game like this, skip the laptop and just build a desktop if that is possible. It will be worlds cheaper than a gaming laptop anyways."
334,Looking to buy a laptop for ARMA III.,"I will upvote you for giving an actual suggestion. Don't know how true the 50-60 FPS on high statement is, but nobody else has actually given a real laptop to start looking at."
335,Looking to buy a laptop for ARMA III.,"Thanks man.  I have an older laptop so I'm looking to get a replacement.  On a good day I can run ARMA III with all the settings down (graphics low, view distance of 0 etc.) at about 25 FPS, spiking at 30 and 15 respectively.

The game looks more like [this](http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/68/7b/687b24_4627130.jpg) than [this](http://www.winboard.org/artikel-attachments/67615d1376473244-arma-3-1.jpg) though.

2. Even a $1,200 dollar computer will not run it as well as it should be. However, with good hardware, the major chokepoint is the processor. High end i7s do the best and are essentially necessary for steady 45+ fps. AMD processors pretty much struggle to run the game."

355,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,I'm interested to know what specs the streamers or guys who play in big squads have. They must have the best overclocked CPU's combined with accessing the game straight off an SSD. 
356,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,"I have the same processor at stock speed and an r9 280x. The game runs at playable frames for the most part, but will often dip frustratingly low in multilayer. In terms of direct competing processors, Intel will do better but the fx-8350 will do alright, especially if overclocked. The only way to get consistently smooth frames is to buy an upper level i7,which isn't worth the cost if ArmA is the only cpu-intensive game you want to play.  To elaborate, ArmA is especially shitty at utilizing multiple cores while And processors kind of focus on that and Intel processors have better pre-configured performance "

358,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,"Oh really? I wasnt aware, both me and a friend got a serious fps increase when we swapped physx from our CPU to the card, since cpu was default, but as you say, we are both using nvidia cards"

Although the motherboard are meant to take AMD products to make do synergy or some crap."

362,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,"I'm not sure as I haven't done the campaign :p

I typically get much better performance in SP as opposed to MP.

Try turning down postprocess and clouds/shadows. See if that improves your FPS a bit and let me know."
363,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,"Hmm, I just looked it up. It's definitely a nvidia specific thing, but apparently you can choose to off load physx to be processed on the cpu so the gpu can focus on other things. As I'm seeing it, you should only do this if your cpu is powerful enough to handle it. And for a game like ArmA 3, which is *heavily* taxing on the cpu, setting Physx to be processed on the GPU would make sense."

I have the i5-4670k that is at 3.8 at the moment, running the game off a SSD and the 4GB version of your graphics card, and can get 60 fps on high with mid/high post processing effects in multiplayer if I dont stream"
366,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,A clanmate of mine has a i7-4770k ocd to some ridiculous clock and 3 titans and he can never get 60 fps. I assume that arma3 is really heavy on cpu usage. With a couple hundred units on the map he gets 40-60 fps but not the 100s that he is used to in other games.
367,My specs are good - why is my ARMA3 performance so bad?,"Not really. Changing the settings doesn't really do much to change my FPS. I can run the game on ultra and get 20 FPS in multiplayer, and turn all the settings down and it only bumps me by a couple frames. "
368,"My take on the ending of ""Win""","IT'S ION, the PMC from the ARMA II DLC.  Miller's one of their boys, and they want the device for some nefarious reason, aka sell to the highest bidder.

Evidence: 

*It's mostly British Operators, and Miller and his boys were all British.


*They're not showing a semi-realistic real time conflict like in ARMA II, so they can take liberties.


*The CSAT seems to have no reason to be involved in this conflict, unless its over the device.


*Miller wants to get it first to sell to them or...

Next campaign could be set in a crumbling implied (N Korea).  They buy device, smuggle into (Seoul) and detonate, bring  (S Korea) to its knees.  Use CSAT SF, and ION operators, to bring (S Korean) military down.

370,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"This game is full of childish people, especially the people that act 12 y/o when they have a mic and can cry wolf easier than a person without a mic."
371,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"If you are looking for some other servers, try the s3kshun61 servers. They have a Stratis Wasteland and Altis Life. They are pretty good, and admins are mature. Filter s3k under host."
372,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"I don't understand how people still offers to sell admin privilege ... Every fricking time whatever it is on CS:S, Gmod, Dayz or Arma it goes insanely wrong. At least have a testing week for the candidate (and DO monitor what the trainee do, if you don't its useless) and keep eyes on them.  "
373,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"Meh, we exclusively play sa matra, and although there have occasionally been some people that might have been exploiting/hacking, the instances are rare and my only complaint is that helicopters with guns need removing"
374,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,I remember killing one of their admins and getting banned too...
375,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"I've experienced the worst. If there was a competition for being the worst admins, these guys would be unstoppable. I got banned because my group killed Pert Eel. I WASN'T EVEN ONLINE THAT DAY.

Avoid MidnightGaming (Sneaky Uncle, Private Pyle, Pert Eel, Sevenluck, Devaldo)

Avoid CodeFourGaming (Deez)

Avoid HostileTakeover (BobbyDigital banned me for just killing him, he claimed I was using ESP) [Here's the active ban appeal thread on their forums](http://www.hostiletakeoverclan.com/forums/14/1249) I hope we clear this one up!"
376,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,Nobody cares.
377,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"I've heard more complaints coming out of midnight gaming than codefourgaming and Hostile Takeover put together. 

So yes, people do care."
378,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"Indeed people care, I too was banned by pert, avoid them their a waste of time"
379,Midnight gaming wasteland server admin abuse warning,"I can relate to this and thanks for posting. My whole squad is banned from that server because of that water camping faggot admin Pert Ell. All he ever does is buy a rebreather and camp the gun store in Limeri (IKR WHAT A LIFE! SUCH EXCITEMENT, WOW). I sent a support ticket to sa-matra & inch (for admin abuse) and he basically told me there's nothing he could do because he has no proof. I then asked if I could pay to run their mod and he told me no, that they are full. So basically there is a monopoly on sa-matra wasteland US west hosting between midnightgaming and codefourgaming and I'm SOL. For this reason we have to play on CA, UK, FR, DE, or RU servers and its getting old quickly with 200+ ping. It's good to know Pert Ell is still sucking dick in the water at lameri bay cause he can't face real combat"
380,Im Streaming Battle Royal!!,Nobody cares. 
381,Need help with a rented server.,"Is the Mod referenced in the startup Parameters. I was on vilayer once, terrible Hoster btw and had to add -mod=""@modName;"" to a Input Field which would then edit the startup Parameters for the arma 3 Server. You should get in Touch wird your Hoster though or there might be a Tutorial Provided by your hoster. Sorry for the weird capitalization"
382,Need help with a rented server.,Hopefully you get some help
383,Good server hosts?,"hfbservers.com $20 for 50 slots. love em

384,Altis life server,Epik-gaming.  Keep an eye your for me.  -GUNZ
385,Altis life server,Their website is not up yet.  Rules are in the map screen after you join.

390,Altis life server,"On mobile, just search Typhon Gaming."
391,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,OP Delivers! Nice job

393,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,Nice piloting skills OP!
394,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,"Nice one, I'll be trying to re-create this all weekend now :)"
395,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,"ArmA 3 is literally the only game that I just can't lift off from the runway...

Even in Star Citizen I'm a better pilot! (Someone made a modded map where you can fly some of the ships, they are way before the DFM version of them so they are pretty much impossible to fly)"
396,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,"Flaps down, throttle up."
397,By request: Solar Tower plane trick: first person edition,"Either you're a really bad pilot or you just rely on assists way too much. Star Citizen isn't insane to fly, it's like flying a lego brick without gravitational pull, ARMA3 has no real assists and makes it more realistic to fly, but still not impossible. "
398,Amazing car collision physics,"Physics relies extremely on server performance, if it is low is start acting weird and you should attempt to smash cars into each other, this sorta stuff could be worse and end up with a exploded vehicle!"
399,Amazing car collision physics,"True, but I think vehicles in general are pretty weird in Arma, or rather lack weight. Even tanks are like feathers. "
400,So someone got the planetside 2 map data out. Anyone want to import them to arma 3?,This is really cool if possible !
401,So someone got the planetside 2 map data out. Anyone want to import them to arma 3?,"I don't know, but i would imagine it would be extremely difficult."
402,So someone got the planetside 2 map data out. Anyone want to import them to arma 3?,Not that easy bud.
403,So someone got the planetside 2 map data out. Anyone want to import them to arma 3?,Didn't think it would be easy. I'm making an attempt myself but it's slow going as I have never really used the map tools.
404,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"You don't need to blow up that apc. 
But there will be an mrap at the fuel truck. :( "
405,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,Are you unable to take over for the guy long enough to make the shot?
406,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"Pretend he's just an ammo bearer and take the launcher from him.

Also, I've never seen an AI hit anything with an RPG. Only give them lock on launchers."
407,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,[deleted]
408,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"I can't seem to take control if him at all. I've done so in the past in a custom mission, but not the main campaign."
409,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"I would, but I don't have any option to take his stuff or order him to drop it :/ I cab go into his backpack and take his extra rockets, but that's it"
410,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"Yea Ive tried this too, and all he does is fire his rifle wildly at it like in the clip above. Its like he doesnt realize he even has AT."
411,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"Ah. Select him with Fkey, press 6, press 0 for next until you see Inventory, then press that. You can now access whatever he has. Drop the launcher, then pick it up yourself."
412,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,It doesn't. Arma AI is not sentient :D
413,Having issues advancing in SP due to squad AI,"Good tip, thanks!"
414,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),More like post fail.  Must have used copyrighted music op.  Video is shut down.
415,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),"Only in fail countries(Germany). Music is working in the rest of the world. But yeah, there's no way around it. The video contains clips with music in the actual video recording. So it's either copyright in Germany or no sound with original music."
416,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),I'm in the US.
417,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),"That's strange as youtube says it's only blocked in: Germany, Saint Pierre and Miquelon."
418,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),I assure you I live in the US.  It says it is blocked for copyright reasons and lists many music companies.
419,Arma 3: The Flying Circus (heli/funny/fail-compilation),"Don't worry, I trust you :D"
420,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"Haha, so unfortunate when this happens. Last night after joining bugged server after bugged server I finally got one that actually worked. It did the spawning loot and all that nonsense and when it spawned the 40 of us in the plane it just happened to be doing a nose dive.  
  
There was panic and everyone freaking out and I believe even some music playing. Then the plane hit the ground at full speed and bodies flew everywhere. RIP that server."
421,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"Wow. Thats a fun way to die.

Got trolled again last night after fighting broken server after broken server. This happened TWICE in the same game. Two bombing zones covered the blue circle and I died to a bomb with only 3 other players left alive. #ragequit"
422,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"Weren't the servers really buggy because of the patches in Arma?

Usually I never a problem but over the last two patches I've had issues just when the servers haven't quite matched the update.

Maybe I'm wrong"
423,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,I'd guess that you are correct. I have never had this many problems with battle royale before. Hopefully they get it sorted out because I love playing it. 
424,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"Yeah the only times I've had these kinds of problems are around patches.

Like this time whenever I'd through a grenade or use a claymore/c4/etc. I'd get disconnected.

But this game is a million times less buggy/glitchy than the DayZ Mod for arma2 so I have no real complaints lol."
425,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,Or throw....I do know English...sort of 
426,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"As annoying as the buggy servers and shit are it is one of the most fun game modes I have played and it is the most satisfying to win. I am a pretty big fan of king of the hill lately too, that is also fun."
427,Battle Royale can be such a troll w/bombing zones,"Oh don't get me wrong for a second, as buggy as this game can feel at times it's only because you're playing such an awesome game that the times something happens it just sucks...but then you get the ""winner winner chicken dinner"" and you're just so satisfied with it all.

Easily one of the most fun solo shooter games I've ever played (not team work based like CS)"
