http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/10/648817378234792008/ 

Due to the extent of changes this patch all ships will need to be remade. This should mostly be subsystem management using the new manager, however any weapons currently being used that are larger than tier 1 they will need to be re-positioned as they have grown in size considerably. Be sure to create a new galaxy as well. 

The workshop will be wiped on November 3rd. This is for many reasons but mainly because the major changes to subsystems have made all previously made designs non-functional . Please be sure to download any designs you like before the wipe happens. These downloaded ships will not be deleted from your install, but they will need to be updated in order to launch. 

It is our intention to push this build to the non test repository on Monday Oct 27th. If you find any issues please be sure to post in the Deb Build bug report forum on the community hub. 

If you have any issues with controls please be sure to reset the controls to defaults, we did some updates to the controls manager.

Saw it on the Steam front page again and decided to give it another go. I love space sims and I like the idea of building my own ship.

However this has got to be the least user-friendly game I've ever played, and I played EVE in a corp for about 2 years. I just couldn't figure out how to do the simplest things and every menu seems obfuscated and unintuitive. Eventually I lost interest and I haven't gone back to it since.

If the devs want more customers they're going to have to sort out the UI and make the game a lot easier to use. All I want to do is build a ship and maybe go kill some pirates, I don't want to have to need a university course to learn all the commands and menus. 

This could be an insanely fun game but please please please include some kind of tutorial, and not one that dumps a ton of information on you in very little time. Maybe some kind of trickle learning curve that starts off simple as hell and gradually gets more complicated.",2014-04-23 04:18:38

I’ve pretty much just created a ship and flew around for a couple of minutes. I honestly believe this game has a lot of potential. So wanted to discuss shipbuilding. 

Ship building:
The number of components that could be used to create a ship. They are interesting and some are pretty unique. Creating a ship, however was overly time consuming and somewhat clunky. Navigating the camera seemed to take a while and even after an hour, the interface, i.e. rotating and placing pieces, still felt awkward. I like taking my time and making each ship unique, but I felt a little discouraged when trying to create something a little more complicated. 

I have no idea if there is any intent on putting a cap on the number of components one can use initially, but I personally was hoping for something like that. I like the feeling of growth and initially, having access to all those parts just seems to... easy. Again, I have no idea if this is just for testing or a final design decision. 

One additional note, I think maybe you should add an arrow or something to tell people which way the front of the ship should face. I designed an entire ship only to find that “engines must be facing the rear,” which happened to be the side of my ship, not the back. Later I realized that you need to build it facing the launch portal, but it was apparent at first and frankly, I was too focused on the white cube in the center to notice anything in the background. 

I’m going to play some more today so I can continue spouting nonsense about my opinion. I have a real itching for a space sim and nobody seems to be scratching, so I want this project to succeed. 

Thanks.

* Removed two resolutions that were smaller than 1280x720 as they caused problems

* Added texture for size 3 bridges 1 and 2

* Updated icons for size 3 bridges 1 and 2

* Fixed SpikeFin01 material assignment, it should now receive color channel information.

* Placed a non-warp speed limit on ships to save relativity from further abuse.

* Color profiles now save with the .col extension instead of the .bin extension. When the Shipyard tries to load color profiles, if there are .bin files in SaveFiles/ColorProfiles, the game will rename them to the .col extension. If you have color profiles saved outside of this folder, manually changing the extension to .col will make them compatible with the game.

* Factions can now be set to spawn specific ships. If a folder is created with the same name as the txt plus “ Ships” and saved ships are placed within it, AI belonging to that faction will use one of those ships. For instance, if a faction is described in Empire.txt, ship saves can be placed in a directory called Empire Ships in SaveFiles/Factions. If the folder does not exist or is empty, ships will be pulled randomly from SaveFiles/ as they are now. Empty directories with the appropriate name (based on the txt files in SaveFiles/Factions) are created automatically if missing upon generating a new galaxy, or if an AI of that faction spawns during gameplay.

* Faction specific color profiles have been implemented. If a saved color profile is placed within the faction ship directories mentioned above, then that color profile will override the colors the ship was saved with. This applies even if no saved ships are present in the faction specific directory and the ship was pulled from the top directory.

* Fixed an issue that prevented zooming in the shipyard camera in some cases

* Will no longer start in fullscreen mode, if you set it to full screen after the initial launch it will remember. This is to resolve some issues people are having with incompatible resolutions.

* A problem with collision layers resulted in the player being effectively invincible to enemy fire. This has been fixed, fly with care.

* Fixed a bug where an engine would be destroyed but the ship would still act as though it had the thrust from that engine.",2013-05-03 18:56:23

An alternate method could be to heavily reduce the rate of fire of cannons, but bump up the shell velocity and damage to make them feel more like cannons and may'be make their shell decal larger.",2013-04-27 17:25:59

EDIT:

As Harabeck posted below:

>0.011

* Implemented collider optimizations which should improve performance when many large ships are in scene.

* Implemented player collider optimization which may improve performance during warp.

* MAC - slight change to file structure so that factions will load, negating issue with generating solar systems",2013-04-26 16:56:58

* Added textures for size 2 cockpits 1, 4, 5, 6. 7 and 8

* Updated Module icons for size 2 cockpits 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8

* Added color profile saving functionality to the Shipyard.

*  Hide UI function now disabled if the ship name input has focus

* Fixed missing icon for Hull 13v1

* Removing the first block you placed in the Shipyard will not longer remove the entire ship along with it. Instead, the neighbor of that block with the most children under it will be set as the new child of the root block.

* Added a button/indicator for part placement mode in the Shipyard

* Title screen: resolution and basic quality options now implemented.

* If the resolution option has not been set before, the game defaults to the desktop resolution.

* Docking and planet collision UI elements have been fixed in Sector.

* Fixed a bug where the AI would always use their kinetic field when the player did, making it nearly impossible to catch them.

* Shipyard camera zoom and pan rates will now scale according to ship size.

Update on Mac and Linux: We will have Mac and Linux versions available as soon as Steam gets some stuff set up on their end.",2013-04-24 17:14:37

* Added textures for size 1 cockpits 7, 8, 9, and 10

* Added textures for size 2 cockpits 1 and 2

* First phase of the Shipyard UI update is now complete

* All parts are displayed in the module panel with a visual icon of the module.

* Removed holographic preview

* The subsystem widow has completely changed. When accessing a parts subsystem inventory it will now show all available space on the left, and all subsystems that you can put into it on the right. If a subsystem takes up more than 1 ‘volume’ of space, the empty spaces will get a red outline and be pushed to the end of the list, these spaces are being used and cannot hold any systems.

* To place a subsystem, simply click on it, no more drag and drop for this mechanic.

* As you add subsystems to a module, it will filter out the ones that can no longer be placed, due to restrictions, or size limitations.

* Added main menu to the shipyard, uses escape to access it.

* Fixed a problem with the main menu in space where the shipyard button would not take you to the shipyard.

* All subsystem icons are temporary and only display text.

* A lot of tooltips still need to be added

* Several fields in the stats panel on the left are not fully functional

Now that the UI is at it's next stage of development we will be working on getting Linux and Mac versions available to the public. ",2013-04-19 16:36:57

* Continuing with our UI update, the first pass for the new in-flight GUI has been implemented.

* The ‘G’ key will bring up the weapon manager. Here you can assigned turrets to weapon groups. In the future, it will also show weapon stats.

* The ‘K’ key will bring up the faction menu. It should be similar in functionality to the previous Scaleform version.

* The ‘M’ key will bring up the map. You can drag the map with the mouse and zoom with scroll wheel. There are also + and - buttons for zooming. The ‘R’ button will reset the map to the original zoom level and on the center of the galaxy. In the future, this will reset to the sector you are in.

* The radar will now let you select a radar contact by clicking the icon, instead of having to click over the object in space.

* Previously, only locking a target displayed its range. Now just selecting a radar contact will display the range as well.

* Upon locking a target, it will automatically be set as the focused target. This means that as soon as you lock a target, you can hit the weapon group key to immediately assign weapons instead of first having to use the F keys to set the focused target.

* Increased size of asteroids.

Next up, we will work on the shipyard UI. Once the UI update is complete, we should be able to begin testing Mac and Linux builds.",2013-04-06 16:15:36
