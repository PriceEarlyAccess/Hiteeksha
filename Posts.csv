I found chips, snacks, sodas, a FUCKING CAN OF MAPLE SYRUP and a saw all in that one house.

Then go out and get to the radio tower and I find more food.

Now since there's a nice maple sapling near the tower I go and take that, right? pretty normal stuff right? not so much because after I do that my stupid ass decides ""I need some arrows too"" so I go on this bullshit goose chase across the east part of Pleasant Valley trying to find another birch branch because the one I was supposed to get didn't fucking spawn. Which has never even happened to me before. EVER.

Then when I finally fucking get it I have to go near the east pond so I can find where in the hell the road is, meanwhile I'm on like 50% health and the sun is setting.

So I go there and find the road, I follow the road, and finally, FINALLY, I can see  Thomas crossings, but oh no, I'm already on 10% health and my game decided that now would also be the perfect time to give me fucking fps drops like hell(thanks MSI afterburner you cunt).

At this point I'm clenching my stomach so hard it's like I'm about to take a dump after eating some Indian curry. 

I get to the door.5%

I try to open the door.2%

Turns out it's the fucking sing.1%

I barely got near the door and I couldn't even open it because of the shaky cam and fps lock.
