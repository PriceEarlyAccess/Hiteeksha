1,[Poll/Discussion] Merge /r/arma3 with /r/arma ?,371,Phantomsmedia,24mtaw,arma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/arma3/comments/24mtaw/polldiscussion_merge_rarma3_with_rarma/,74,"Hi! A year ago, a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/arma3/comments/1aajr7/petition_to_disable_this_subreddit_and_combine_it/) was submitted to /r/arma3 asking for the exact same thing. It was ignored by the moderators then, even though it is the highest voted post on all of /r/arma3 *ever*.

 So, would you folks like to have /r/arma3 merge with /r/arma? 

 My thoughts are: The community doesn't have an /r/arma1 or /r/arma2. There shouldn't be an ArmA specific community as the general ArmA community isn't large enough. The content should be centered in one subreddit, and that would be the main one. 

******
***Rules to the poll***: If you agree with merging, leave an upvote and perhaps throw your opinion in the comments. If you disagree, leave a downvote, and again, your opinion in the comments.
******
This will be crossposted to /r/arma to gain the opinion of the entire ArmA community, rather than just /r/arma3.

And if the majority wishes to merge, what would be the best way to disable and redirect this subreddit?",2014-05-03 10:36:41

What's worse is that when I tried to explore around in order to figure out what's broken the game has the audacity to kill me on the spot because I left the operation area and to tell me I am a shameful cheat every time I use the 'endmission' command in order to compensate for the poor work.

When I started the new Win campaign, I have had to restart it 3 times so far. And twice now because of dialogue not happening when its supposed to leaving me frozen staring at the briefing guy, not allowing me to continue down to arm myself.

Ive really been doing the math on the cost benefit analysis of buying VS leasing a dedicated server. 60$us for a 10 slot server is getting a bit heavy in the wallet as the months roll onto years.. 
Where I'm lost is whether or not an older dual processor, 3ghz Xeon based quad core server or the posted dedicated desktop style system requirements would prove to be the most advantageous and efficient.

I won't admit to understanding the nuances that differentiate servers from desktops.

BI clearly calls for the use of end user hardware, even the OS. Not at all the sort of sys-reqs I would have expected in support of a dedicated server binary.

A server is slower with regard to IOPS/FLOPS, but with twice the cores we can certainly get more done across the board I would think. Comms/ArmaSync repository/website/ftp/ the works. All without interfering with each other. But i could be terribly wrong and don't want to commit any cash till i get a better bearing on all this.
Would 15k SCSI drives in a Raid0 be somewhat comparable to SSD's? I used to use 15k raptor drives for real time, zero-latency audio recording a decade ago.
ArmA dedi-server cant be more demanding than that, can it?

I'm genuinely not sure if a modern bare-bones desktop or an older windows 2003 server based machine with dual quad 3ghz Xeons would be best. 
The price points are about equal, leaning towards the higher end of the spectrum with modern PC's of course.

Any knowledge on the subject or ideas?
Would such a machine be able to run an Arma dedicated server & HC?

Description:  This is a collection of basic information for newcomers to Arma 3.  It 
contains some tips and links to other people's guides.  All content is credited to its 
author and contains links to the source material.  For a more complete guide to Arma 3, 
including advanced information and strategy/tactics, I recommend a full read of Dslyecxi's 
TTP3 guide linked below.

Topics marked with an * indicate the most critical information which should be reviewed on 
first read.

Tips:

	Under the Play option in Arma 3 is the showcases tab.  These showcases are tutorial
	scenarios which you can use to learn how to play Arma 3.

	Familiarize your self with the Key-binds.  Arma 3 has an unusually extensive and
	complicated control scheme, and an examination of the default key-binds is
	recommended as some may not be to your liking.

	The scroll wheel is the basic method of interaction with anything in Arma 3, including
	doors, items, vehicles, and other people.

Warning: Most of these guides were based on the Alpha for Arma 3, so it is possible that 	
some information is outdated.

Now Ive tried a few things, i run process lasso, i have disabled cpu/gpu(?) parking, I run game booster, and keep my system quite clean, could antivirus/malwarebytes or the like be hampering preformance?

Also sometimes low graphics make it worse while high graphics make it better, ive noticed this in quite a few games but i cant seem to get the best fit for my rig, the ingame FPS counter is not to be trusted.

Any help is appreciated, I have read the most commonly avavible guides out there so linking to them would be a waste of time but thanks anyways.",2014-04-30 16:55:37

51,Core Tactical - An ArmA community that wants you!,0,,24c1z2,arma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/arma3/comments/24c1z2/core_tactical_an_arma_community_that_wants_you/,2,"**What is Core Tactical all about?**

Core Tactical is based off the idea off ""Tactical Fun"", and we like to stand by this ideal as we play in and outside of ArmA. The ""Tactical"" part reflects the way we communicate, move, and function on a large scale. The ""Fun"" part reflects the way we go about making the experience for our members and ourselves. Basically were looking to make the best experience possible for all of our member base. Most of our missions revolve around intense close quarters infantry contact, with other units/assets acting as supporting elements. 

We aren't looking for easy, clean and cut scenarios. We like throwing ourselves into intense situations, we want are victories to be earned through teamwork, skill, and determination. If we don't put our all in, we don't expect to come out on top. 

All of our missions are made in house by members within the community. We provide a wide variety of cooperative and adversarial scenarios. From an air cav squad in the heart of Nam', to a Russian Spetsnaz unit infiltrating into enemy bases. In our adversarial scenarios we are able to take advantage of human dynamics to change the way our missions play and interact with the player.

**Core Tactical's Virutes**

Core Tactical has hereby been established to serve as a mature community that focuses on tactical fun. We believe that any set community should be set on a few common principles, which are listed below.

* Respect - Simple, treat others as you would like to be treated. If you are found to be disrespecting other members, you can expect to see yourself out the door.
*  Well Thought out Tactics - Maintain a high level of tactical game play no matter the situation or scenario.
* Motivated Leaders - We strive for a high degree of competency in our playerbase insofar as leadership goes, as well as pride ourselves on how well our non-leading players will follow orders and conduct themselves in any given mission. We find that alot of times people are scared to step up to the plate and take that Squad Leader position, thinking that people will get angry at them for leading them to death or something. While in reality a squad of Core Tactical members will gladly follow you to the gates of hell if need be.
* Professionalism - Always exhibit a supreme level of professionalism in and out of the community's official sessions.
* Quality over Quantity - At Core Tactical we are always looking for the quality of our player base, over our player count.



**What makes a good Core Tactical member?**

Core Tactical expects a certain level of quality from members, at all times. You are expected to follow the virtues listed above, as well as abiding by our technical obligations. 

When it comes to looking over an application, were looking for individuals who generally meet some of the criteria below.
-At least 16 years of age.
-Good sense of humor.
-Friendly respectful and mature.
-Teamwork-oriented mindset.
-Motivated and dedicated to making the group and our experiences the best they can be.

Running through the jungle, enemies close by, I came up behind someone with a PDW. I yell into group chat ""Well, this is awkward, I'm running behind someone"". Neither of us had time to take a shot off, we were getting hurt because we were 150m out of the radius. This is where it gets amazing...

I get hurt enough that I'm forced to walk. The guy I'm following turns around and goes ""I'm going to drop you a medkit"". He runs to me and then he is also slowed. We both heal and keep running. He had given me his second last medkit and just used his last one on himself. I was ahead of him and made it into the radius. He had not made it inside the radius in time and was stuck in prone and he had to roll into the radius just in time.

I never saw him again, one of the other players found and murdered him. I was able to take refuge behind a rock on the coast, hidden by the water. I ended up winning the game.

But if you pay attention to the hints and tips, a few of them mention the ruins on the islands and an ancient civilization that ""sank beneath the sea"". I suspect that the earthquake devices were made by either CSAT or NATO black ops (not sure which) with the intention of raising this civilization from the depths of the sea. For CSAT, it would potentially mean exploiting treasures and maybe some ancient technologies; NATO/Millar would be interested in the scientific pursuit of it, and potentially ancient technologies again.

&nbsp;  

***“Provide a fun, immersive & authentic Australian ArmA gaming experience supported by a democratic, persistent and active community of mature gamers”.***
&nbsp;  

In other words, we don’t refer to each other by our ranks and salute the Officers among us when we are in-game like some of the other realism units out there, but we do pride ourselves on maintaining a fun, immersive and authentic ArmA gaming experience – yes, this means that good old fashioned Aussie banter is welcome, but when the bullets start flying, it’s time to get our A-Game on.
With SOCOMD’s founder being an ex-member of the RAAF’s Airfield Defence Guards (ADG’s), and many more members having either served previously, or are currently serving in the Australian Defence Force, this is the unit for you if you want an immersive and authentic Australian ArmA gaming experience, with the main goal of having **SERIOUS FUN!** 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
**WHEN DO YOU GUYS PLAY?**  
SOCOMD Mission schedules are based around Australian and NZ time-zones (typically GMT +10). We are not exclusive to Australians and accept all who are willing to play within these time-zones. We run Official Operations (hosted and organised by designated members) 6 days a week and run many Unofficial Operations (hosted by any willing community members - yes, that means you too) every single day of the week.

&nbsp;  

**HOW IS SOCOMD STRUCTURED?**  
We do not employ an overbearing Ranking structure. Ranks within SOCOMD are there to ensure that our gaming can be as smooth and efficient as possible. It is also a way for us to indicate who has training for specific roles within the platoons. As far as ranking goes, every single member in SOCOMD is as valuable to us as the next (except 5th Av, they're expendable). At SOCOMD, nobody will force you to do something that you do not want to do. However, should you volunteer as such, your sacrifice WILL be noted and appreciated.

**SOUNDS AWESOME, SIGN ME UP!**

Applying is as simple as filling out a short Application Form. A SOCOMD representative will get back to you within 2 days at the very latest. We ensure that applicants and recruits do not have to bare long application times. Instead, we prefer to get you in and playing with us straight away, as that is the best way to familiarise with each other. We strongly recommend getting in now whilst we are growing fast.

**OKAY, YOU'RE RAMBLING HERE AND I'M NOT QUITE SOLD. ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY?**

* SOCOMD takes pride in providing exclusive content that you will not find anywhere else. Recently we have employed the use of Zeus within our Official Operations for those who are looking for a dynamic and intense ArmA gaming experience.  


* SOCOMD will never ignore its members and takes all opinions and suggestions seriously. We ensure that every community member's opinion is heard across the whole of SOCOMD by organising frequent community central 'round table' discussion events.


* Not only do we have 75 registered members (and counting), we also conduct frequent joint operations with other Australian ArmA Teams, such as Borderline Tactical, so we can truly push for those large scale operations.


* We have members working hard behind the scenes to ensure that SOCOMD is a friendly, harassment free environment and that all our Official Operations are of highest quality. Of our 75 registered members, not a single one has yet to exclaim that they do not enjoy themselves.


* Within SOCOMD, there is more for you to do than slay enemies. We look for community input in other ways such as Mission Editing, Video submissions, Writers and many more community based tasks. In the end, it's community involvement that keeps SOCOMD healthy.

I get him in position, tell him to hold fire, then when it comes near, order him to engage. He proceeds to fire at it with his rifle a few times while it drives away, shooting at him. Sometimes he finally decides AT would be better and tries to switch, and fire. Most of the time misses, if hes not already destroyed by cannon fire, but just getting him to fire ANY AT is the main problem.

I really need to figure out how to make him switch weapons before the engagement. I really would have thought that AI AT soldiers would know better. Thoughts?

FYI this is the single player campaign, not a mission Ive made.
